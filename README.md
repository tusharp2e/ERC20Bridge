# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat compile // to compile 
npx hardhat run scripts/kalpBridge.js --network localhost // to deploy on hardhat node 
npx hardhat run scripts/kalpBridge.js --network <Network Name> // to deploy on hardhat node
npx hardhat test // to  run tests 
```
